                <h1>The Cells Produce Eletrical Current</h1>
                <p>A thin semiconductor wafer comprised of two layers of silicon is contained within each solar cell. An electric field is created when two layers are positively and negatively charged. A photovoltaic solar cell is energised by solar light energy, which also causes electrons to "come loose" from atoms within the semiconductor wafer. The electric field surrounding the wafer causes those unbound electrons to move, and this movement results in an electrical current.</p>

                <h1>The Electrical Energy is Converted</h1>
                <p>You now have solar panels that efficiently convert sunshine into electricity, but the electricity they produce is referred to as direct current (or DC) electricity, not the alternating current (or AC) electricity that powers the majority of homes. Fortunately, a device called an inverter makes it simple to convert DC current into AC electricity. These inverters can be set up in contemporary solar systems as a single inverter for the entire system or as separate microinverters attached behind the panels.</p>

            <div class="article_content">
                <h1>The Converted Electricity Powers your home</h1>
                <p>After being transformed from DC to AC electricity, the solar energy is dispersed throughout the house to power your appliances. Nothing inside the home needs to alter because it operates exactly the same as the electricity your electric utility provider generates through the grid. You can automatically draw additional electricity to make up for any solar power shortfalls from the grid because you are still connected to your traditional power provider.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>Knowing the fundamentals of solar energy allows you to marvel at how modern photovoltaic technology can harness the sun's immense power to run a home. It may not be rocket science, but it is unquestionably the height of human inventiveness.</p>
