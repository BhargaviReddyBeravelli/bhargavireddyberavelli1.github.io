            <p>Electricity can be produced using solar panels for both domestic and business use. In both situations,
                the photovoltaic panels are put on the roof to get the most sunlight possible and produce the most
                electricity from the system.</p>

            <p> The stages involved in installation are as follows:</p>
            <div class="steps">
                <ul class="install_steps">
                    <li>Step-1: Mount Installation</li>

                </ul>

            <div class="article_content" style="margin-top: 16px">
                <h1>Step-1: Mount Installation</h1>
                <p>The mounts needed to hold the solar panels must first be fixed. Depending on the need, it may be
                    flush mounts or roof-ground mounts. Support and durability are provided by this basic structure. The
                    direction in which the PV panels—monocrystalline or polycrystalline—will be mounted is carefully
                    considered. The optimum direction to face solar panels for nations in the Northern Hemisphere is
                    south because it receives the most sunshine. Directions to the east and west will also work. The
                    ideal direction is north for nations in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>Again, a minor tilt is required for the mounting structure. The tilt's angle can range from 18 to 36
                    degrees. A solar tracker is frequently used by businesses to improve conversion efficiency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article_content">
                <h1>Step-2: Install the Solar Panels</h1>
                <p>The solar panels must then be attached to the mounting system as the next stage. Nuts and bolts are
                    tightened to do this. To ensure that the entire structure is solid and long-lasting, care is taken
                    to properly secure it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article_content">
                <h1>Step-3: Do Electrical Wiring</h1>
                <p>The electrical wiring comes next. Since they may be linked to all types of solar panels, universal
                    connectors like MC4 are utilised during wiring. The following set of connections between these
                    panels is possible electrically:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Series Connection: </b>In this arrangement, the Positive (+) and Negative (-) wires of two PV
                        modules are connected in series. The voltage match with the battery bank is improved with this
                        style of wiring.
                    </li>
                    <li>Positive (+) to Positive (+) and negative (-) to negative (-) connections are made in this
                        instance. Each panel's wiring voltage remains the same.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="article_content">
                <h1>Step-4: Connect the System to Solar Inverter</h1>
                <p>The system must next be connected to a solar inverter. Both the Positive and Negative wires from the
                    solar panel are linked to the inverter's Positive and Negative terminals, respectively.</p>

                <p>The grid input and solar battery are then linked to the solar inverter to create electricity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article_content">
                <h1>Step-5: Connect Solar Inverter and Solar Battery</h1>
                <p>The solar inverter and solar battery must then be connected. Positive to positive and negative to negative connections are made between the battery's positive terminal and the inverter's positive terminal. To store backup electricity, an off-grid solar system needs batteries.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article_content">
                <h1>Step-6: Connect Solar Inverter to the Grid</h1>
                <p>The inverter must then be connected to the grid. A regular plug is used to connect to the main power switch board in order to create this connection. The electric board that supplies electricity to the dwelling is connected with an output wire.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="article_content">
                <h1>Step: 7: Start Solar Inverter</h1>
                <p>It's time to turn on the inverter switch at the main switch of the house now that all of the electrical cabling and connections have been made. The majority of solar inverters have a digital display that shows statistics on the generation and usage of solar equipment.</p>
